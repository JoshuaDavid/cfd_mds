<h4>RUI: The Role of Facial Physiognomy in Stereotypic Trait Inference</h4>
<i>Debriefing</i>
<p>The study in which you just participated seeks to examine face perception. We are interested in assessing what features and characteristics make faces appear more similar and more dissimilar. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to create a database of pictures featuring different people making different facial expressions of emotions. This database of images will be used in future investigations by researchers at University of Chicago and California State University at Northridge, and will be made available to other researchers at other universities for research purposes. This research is funded by the National Science Foundation and is being supervised by Debbie Ma PhD.</p>
