	    <i>Introduction and Description</i>
	    <p>You are invited to participate in a research project on face perception. The goal of this project is to create a database of pictures featuring different people making different facial expressions of emotions. This database of images will be used in future investigations by researchers at University of Chicago and California State University at Northridge, and will be made available to other researchers at other universities for research purposes. This research is funded by the National Science Foundation and is being supervised by Debbie Ma PhD. </p>
	    <i>Voluntary Participation</i>
	    <p>Although your participation is greatly valued, you have the right to withdraw your consent and leave the study at any time without prejudice.</p>
