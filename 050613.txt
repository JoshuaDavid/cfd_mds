    Today was a pretty good day, though I didn't end up getting very much done during it. Still, I'm working tomorrow and I think I'll work on Debbie's stuff. I may implement an MDS algorithm in JavaScript, and if I do, I think I'll open-source it. I think I understand approximately *what* mds algorithms do (condense a set of n-dimensional points that satisfy a set of distance requirements into a smaller number of dimensions), but I am unsure of how exactly the algorithms do that.
    Think I'll stop at 170 push ups today, leaving me with a 200 push up debt.
